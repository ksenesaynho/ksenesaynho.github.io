Recently, I find myself contemplating about my future and what really makes me happy as a whole.  I have a creative and very analytical mindset and lately I’ve felt that in my current career that I have to limit my potential. I want a career where I can create and explore new ideas while helping to fix and solve problems and continue to learn something new every day.


For the past two years I’ve pondered back and forth with programming that I questioned myself and wondered, “What am I going to do and why do I want to do it?” In a way I wanted to prove to myself that I could do anything I wanted to do with the right mindset, dedication and hard work. I thought that now is the time, so I am going to give this everything I got so I can learn new skills, expand my talents and see what I could really do for myself personally and professionally. I want to genuinely enjoy what I do and I think with coding I can do exactly that.
